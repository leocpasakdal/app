# Building The App

This process is not practical for development, but it will replicate the steps required for production. Following this tutorial will generate the JavaScript bundles and other assets files like images.

### After cloning the repo, first of all install the dependencies:

    $ npm install

### Now you can run the build command :

    $ npm run start:dev # run build command and will start the server in development mode
    $ npm run start # used by heroku to build the app and start the server with production config

These commands will run build command and will start a server which you can run and test on your local machine.
